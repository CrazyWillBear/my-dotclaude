# infra

Scripts-only shared layer. Other plugins call these scripts; infra calls into nothing.

## `spawn.sh` — two forms, one command

A **worker** is one-shot and owns one issue; a **peer** is a standing role session that idles
between briefs and is rotated by handoff ([`docs/swarm-design.md` § Topology](../../docs/swarm-design.md)).
They share one command builder on purpose — the same name, denylist, `bypassPermissions`,
`--system-prompt-snapshot off` and closed stdin — because letting them drift apart is the
reinvention this kit replaces.

```bash
# worker: tier-routed model, fenced to its worktree, started from it
bash ~/.claude/kit/infra/scripts/spawn.sh <runid> <issue> <tier> <worktree> <base> [--role build|fix]

# peer: named by its role, carrying the charter and its brief
bash ~/.claude/kit/infra/scripts/spawn.sh peer --name swe-manager \
     --brief b.md --charter c.md --model opus --effort high [--handoff h.md] [--autocompact 400k]
```

A peer's `--name` **is** its stable address: rotation stops the process and respawns under the
same name, so there is no run prefix. `--charter`'s text is appended to the system prompt (the CLI
has no `--append-system-prompt-file`), and `--handoff` prepends a read-this-first instruction
naming the predecessor's doc, before the brief. Peers are not tier-routed — their roster row
carries the model. `--dry-run` prints the command one argument per line.

## The stable address

A plugin's install path is a versioned cache directory, so no other plugin can find infra
by relative path. Instead, infra's `SessionStart` hook keeps a symlink at
`~/.claude/kit/infra` pointing at its own root, and every caller uses that one path:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/kit/infra/scripts/session-status.sh --self
```

The link appears on the first session start after install, and is repointed on every
start, so it follows version bumps. If a real directory sits at that path, the hook
refuses and says so rather than delete it.
